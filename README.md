# Check-in-system-data-parser
Python program to parse data output by Monitor.py. Reads the file and provides information on service times, queue times, arrival times.

This was part of a group assigmnent in which we recorded and analysed arrival and check-in times for passengers on the Bluebridge ferry.
My part of the assignment was the data processing as shown in this program.
